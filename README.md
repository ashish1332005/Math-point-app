# Math Point

Math Point is a full-stack student management and learning platform built for a coaching or institute workflow. It combines a public-facing website with separate admin and student panels so the institute can manage courses, materials, attendance, fees, notifications, and results from one system.

## Overview

This project is split into two parts:

- `frontend` - React + Vite application for the website, student panel, and admin panel
- `backend` - Express + MongoDB API for authentication, student management, course management, results, fees, attendance, and notifications

## Main Features

### Public Website

- Home page with dedicated sections such as hero, about, courses, faculties, results, gallery, testimonials, and contact
- Public course listing
- Faculty and contact pages
- Student registration and login

### Admin Panel

- Admin dashboard
- Student registration and student list management
- Course creation and course assignment to students
- Student panel access control
- Study material upload with file support using `multer`
- Attendance management by course and date
- Payment and fee record tracking
- Notification creation and editing
- Result upload from CSV, draft creation, and publishing

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Maths
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/` and add:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/math-point
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Running the Project

### Start the backend

From the `backend` folder:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Start the frontend

From the `frontend` folder:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend is configured to call the backend at:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Database Seeding

To seed demo users, run this command from the `backend` folder:

```bash
node seed.js
```

This creates:

- Admin: `admin@mathpoint.com` / `admin123`
- Student: `student@mathpoint.com` / `password`

## Authentication and Access

- JWT-based authentication is used for protected API routes
- Admin routes are protected with `protect` and `admin` middleware
- Student routes are protected with `protect` middleware
- Students can log in using email, and the backend also supports login using `studentId`

## Notes

- Uploaded files are served from `backend/uploads`
- The frontend currently uses a hardcoded API base URL in `frontend/src/services/api.js`
- The `register-admin` route is public in the current implementation and should be secured before production use
- There are no automated tests configured yet in this repository

## Future Improvements

- Add role-based route guards in the frontend
- Move frontend API base URL to environment variables
- Add validation and error handling improvements
- Add automated tests for API and UI
- Secure admin bootstrap and production deployment settings
